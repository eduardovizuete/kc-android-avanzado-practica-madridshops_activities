Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------
1. When starting the App for the first time, if there's Internet
connection it will download all information from the Activities
access point (see below), including all images.
2. The App will cache everything locally: images, data, etc. Even
maps. See below for tips
3. Next time the App is started, if more than 7 days has passed the
cache will be invalidated (deleted) and everything will be2/12
downloaded again.
4. If there's no Internet connection a message will be shown to the
user.
5. The app will have a main menu screen where we'll add one button
& a logo. The button takes us to the list of shops.
6. The list of activities will show in the upper 50% screen a map with
one pin for each shop.
7. The list of activities will show in the lower 50% screen. Logo to the
left, background image taking all the row, activity name in the
front. Tapping a row takes us to the detail activity screen.
8. If you tap on a pin in the map a callout will open with the logo +
activity name. Taping the callout takes us to the detail activity
screen.
9. The map will be always centered in madrid, showing also the user
location
10. We can filter activity using a search bar accesible in the activities
screen. While filtering, activities will be removed from the list and
map
11. All data is at least in Spanish & English: should cache all and
display in Spanish (if that's our phone's language) or English
otherwise
12. Activity detail screen should show shop name, description,
address, and a map showing the activity's location without any pin
(just the are around the Activity)
